Hash Tables / Dictionaries (via Django ORM):

🔹 Best Interview Answer (Crisp):

“In my College Social Network Website project, we used lists/arrays for handling posts and comments, hashmaps/dictionaries for fast retrieval of user data via Django ORM, a graph-like structure to represent user connections, and queues for real-time message handling. These data structures ensured efficiency and smooth functioning of the platform.”
